QUESTION:

C programming has several in-built functions to perform input and output tasks.

Two commonly used functions for I/O (Input/Output) are System.out.println() and System.in().

Write a program to get the string as input and print it.

The System.in() function reads formatted input from the keyboard. When the user enters a string (i.e) char array, it is stored in variable testString.

Format string %s is used in case of string which is an array of character types.

Note the '&' sign before testString is not needed, the value will be stored starting from the base address.



NOTE: Bold letters or words are Input and rest are output statements.



Sample Input - 1:

Sample Output - 1:

import java.util.Scanner;
class Main
{
    public static void main(String args[])
    {
        String str;
        Scanner obj= new Scanner(System.in);
        str=obj.next();
        System.out.printf("%s",str);
    }
}
