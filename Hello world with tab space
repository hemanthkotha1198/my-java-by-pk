There are few escape sequences which is used for formatting the output in the c programming language, you have to use \t escape sequence in order to provide 4 to 5 spaces between words in the output console.

Enter the escape sequence directly into the System.out.println() statement's within the inverted commas ("mes\tsage").



Sample Output:
Hello World Hello World

import java.util.Scanner;
class Main
{
    public static void main(String args[])
    {
        System.out.println("Hello world\t Hello world");
    }
}
