Write a program to find the median of the elements in the array.

Median is the middle value in sorted list. If there are even number of elements in the list, median is the mean of the 2 middle values.

Input and Output Format:

Input consists of n+1 integers where n corresponds to the number of elements in the array.

The first integer corresponds to n and the next n integers correspond to the elements in the array.

Output consists of a double value which corresponds to the median of the array. It is printed upto 2 digits of precision.

Assume that the maximum number of elements in the array is 20.

Refer sample input and output for formatting specifications.

All text in bold corresponds to input and the rest corresponds to output.
Sample Input and Output :

 

Enter the number of elements in the array

5

Enter the elements in the array

2

4

1

3

5

The median of the array is 3.00

import java.util.*;
class Main
{
    public static void main(String args[])
    {
       
		int n,i;
		Scanner Sc= new Scanner (System.in);
		System.out.println("Enter the number of elements in the array");
		n= Sc.nextInt();
		int arr[]=new int[n];
		System.out.println("Enter the elements in the array ");
		for(i=0;i<n;i++)
		{
			arr[i]= Sc.nextInt();
		}
		Arrays.sort(arr);   
		int len=n/2;
		float a=arr[len];
 System.out.printf("The median of the array is %.2f",a);

    }
}
