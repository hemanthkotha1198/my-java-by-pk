QUESTION:

C programming has several in-built functions to perform input and output tasks.

Two commonly used functions for I/O (Input/Output) are System.out.println() and System.in().

Write a program to get float as input and print it.

The System.in() function reads formatted input from the keyboard. When the user enters a float, it is stored in variable testFloat.

Format string %f is used in case of float types.

Note the '&' sign before testFloat; &testFloat gets the address of testFloat and the value is stored in that address.

Use '%.2f' in the System.out.println() to display float value with 2 precisions.



NOTE: Bold letters or words are Input and rest are output statements.



Sample Input - 1:

56.2425

Sample Output - 1:

56.24

Sample Input - 2:

92.00

Sample Output - 2:

92.00


import java.util.Scanner;
class Main
{
    public static void main(String args[])
    {
        float a;
        Scanner obj =new Scanner(System.in);
        a=obj.nextFloat();
        System.out.printf("%.2f",a);
        
    }
}
