QUESTION:

ASCII - American Standard Code for Information Interchange.

Write a program to get a character as input and print it's ASCII value.

When a character is entered, the character itself is not stored. Instead, a numeric value(ASCII value) is stored.

And when we displayed that value using "%c" text format, the entered character is displayed.

NOTE: Bold letters or words are Input and rest are output statements.



Sample Input :

g

Sample Output:

103

import java.util.Scanner;
class Main
{
    public static void main(String args[])
    {
        char a;
        Scanner obj = new Scanner(System.in);
        a=obj.next().charAt(0);
        int asciivalue=(int)a;
        System.out.println(asciivalue);
    }
}
