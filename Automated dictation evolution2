In these days kids are introduced to computers at a very early age and in some schools the dictation test is conducted using computers. The teachers found it a bit difficult to evaluate these tests and they requested the school management to lessen their burden by automating this task. The 12th class students are learning C programming and they took up the task of automating the dictation evaluation. The students have not been introduced to string functions yet. Can you please help them out?
