QUESTION:

Sheela has three things in her bag. She wants to compute the area of 3 things but 3 things are in different shapes. The three things are in square shape, rectangular shape, and circular shape respectively. 

Write a program to help Sheela to calculate the area of different shapes.

Input format:
First input: a side of a square in integer

Second input: length of a rectangle in integer

Third input: breadth of a rectangle in integer

Fourth input: radius of a circle in float

Output format:

The first output should be the area of a square in integer

The second output should be the area of a rectangle in integer

The third output should be the area of a circle in float with 2 decimal places

Sample Input:

5
5
4
2.0
Sample Output:
25
20

import java.util.Scanner;
class Main
{
    public static void main(String args[])
    {
        int side,l,b;
        float r;
        Scanner obj= new Scanner(System.in);
        side=obj.nextInt();
        l=obj.nextInt();
        b=obj.nextInt();
        r=obj.nextFloat();
        double area=(r*r*3.14);
        System.out.println(side*side);
        System.out.println(l*b);
        System.out.print(area);
    }
}
