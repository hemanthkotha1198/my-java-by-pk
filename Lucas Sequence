QUESTION:

a = 0, b=0, c=1 are the 1st three terms. All other terms in the Lucas sequence are generated by

the sum of their 3 most recent predecessors.

Write a program to generate the first n terms of a Lucas Sequence.


Input format:

The input containing an integer 'n' which denotes the given number



Output format:

Print the  'n' terms of the Lucas Sequence, separated by a single space. There are no leading or trailing spaces in the output.

Refer the sample output for formatting.



Sample Input:

5



Sample Output:

0 0 1 1 2

import java.util.Scanner;
class Main
{
    public static void main(String args[])
    {
        int n1=0,n2=0,n3=1,n4=0,i,count;    
    
    Scanner sc = new Scanner (System.in);
    count=sc.nextInt();
System.out.print(n1+" "+n2+" "+n3+" ");
 for(i=0;i<(count-3);++i)    
 {   
     n4=n1+n2+n3;
         
  n1=n2;    
  n2=n3;  
     n3=n4;
     
     
     
 // n3=n1+n2;    
 // n1=n2;    
  //n2=n3;    
    System.out.print(n4+" ");
    }
}}
