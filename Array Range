Write a program to find the range of the elements in the array.

Range of an array is the difference between the maximum and minimum element in an array,

 Input and Output Format:

Input consists of n+1 integers where n corresponds to the number of elements in the array.

The first integer corresponds to n and the next n integers correspond to the elements in the array.

Output consists of an integer which corresponds to the range of the array.

Assume that the maximum number of elements in the array is 20.

Refer sample input and output for formatting specifications.

All text in bold corresponds to input and the rest corresponds to output.

 Sample Input and Output :

 Enter the number of elements in the array

5

Enter the elements in the array

2

4

1

3

5

The range of the array is 4

import java.util.*;
class Main
{
    public static void main(String args[])
    {
       
		int n,i;
		Scanner Sc= new Scanner (System.in);
		System.out.println("Enter the number of elements in the array");
		n= Sc.nextInt();
		int arr[]=new int[n];
		System.out.println("Enter the elements in the array ");
		for(i=0;i<n;i++)
		{
			arr[i]= Sc.nextInt();
		}
		Arrays.sort(arr);   
 System.out.printf("The range of the array is %d",arr[n-1]-arr[0]);
 

    }
}
