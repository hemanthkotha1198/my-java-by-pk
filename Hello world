QUESTION:

This is the very first program in the programming language, you have to include an only single header file that is import java.util.Scanner;, this header file contains the declaration of System.out.println()function.

System.out.println() is used to display the message as well as the value on the standard output device (monitor), use of printf function is very easy, you have to just pass the string (message) that you want to print on the screen within inverted commas ("message").

Sample Output:

Hello World

import java.util.Scanner;

class Main
{
  public static void main(String args[])
  {
   System.out.println("Hello World");
  }
}
