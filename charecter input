QUESTION:

C programming has several in-built functions to perform input and output tasks.

Two commonly used functions for I/O (Input/Output) are System.out.println() and System.in().

Write a program to get a character as input and print it.

The System.in() function reads formatted input from the keyboard. When the user enters a character, it is stored in variable testCharacter.

Format specifier %c is used in case of character types.

Note the '&' sign before testCharacter; &testCharacter gets the address of testCharacter and the given value is stored in that address.



NOTE: Bold letters or words are Input and rest are output statements.


Sample Input:

z

Sample Output:

z

import java.util.Scanner;
class Main
{
    public static void main(String args[])
    {
        char a;
        Scanner obj=new Scanner(System.in);
        a=obj.next().charAt(0);
        System.out.println(a);
    }
}
