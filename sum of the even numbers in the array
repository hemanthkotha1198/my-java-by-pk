Output Format:

Refer sample output for details.

Sample Input :

5

2

3

6

8

-1

Sample Output 1:

The sum of the even numbers in the array is 16

import java.util.Scanner;
class Main
{
    public static void main(String args[])
    {
       
		int n,i,sum= 0;
		Scanner Sc= new Scanner (System.in);
		n= Sc.nextInt();
		int arr[]=new int[n];
		for(i=0;i<n;i++)
		{
			arr[i]= Sc.nextInt();
		}
		for(i=0;i<n;i++)
		{
            if(arr[i]%2==0)
            {
                sum=sum+arr[i];
            }
		}
		System.out.println("The sum of the even numbers in the array is "+sum);
    }
}
