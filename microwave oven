QUESTION:

A microwave oven manufacturer recommends that when heating two items, add 50% to the

heating time, and when heating three items double the heating time. Heating more than

three items at once is not recommended. Write a program to find out the recommended heating time.



Input format:

The first input containing an integer which denotes the number of items

The second input containing the floating point number which denotes the single item heating time.



Output format:

Print the recommended heating time in floating point with 2 decimal places.

If the number of items is more than three, print "Number of items is more" 

Refer the sample output for formatting



Sample Input:

2

5.0



Sample Output:

7.50

import java.util.Scanner;
class Main
{
public static void main(String args[])
{
int count_item;
float heat_time;
double total_time=0;
Scanner obj=new Scanner(System.in);
count_item=obj.nextInt();
heat_time=obj.nextFloat();
if(count_item>3)
{
    System.out.println("Number of items is more");
}
else
{
    if(count_item==1)
    {
       total_time=heat_time; 
    }
    else if(count_item==2)
    {
       total_time=heat_time*1.5;
    }
    else if(count_item==3)
    {
        total_time=heat_time*2;
    }
    System.out.println(total_time);
}
}
}
