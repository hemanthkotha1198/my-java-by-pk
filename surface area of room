 	Goal
You must print true (or false) if you have enough paint to cover the whole inner surface of the house.
The paint stock is Q in liters.
There are N rooms in the house.
We'll' assume that 1L of paint will cover 5mÂ².
In each room, walls, floor and ceiling must be painted (with one layer).
Don't mind about doors and windows, paint them all!
Input
Line1 : The paint stock in liters Q
Line2 : The number of rooms to be painted N
N next lines : X, Y, Z are the room dimensions in meters
Output
true if you have enough paint to cover the whole inner surface, false if not.
Constraints
N >= 0
X, Y, Z <= 9
